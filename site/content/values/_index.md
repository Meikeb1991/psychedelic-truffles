      "It was a deep, expanding journey, I really wanted to explore 
      what was holding me back and what I needed to move on in life.
      My own preparation and Meike's guidance and support helped me
      discover what I needed. I still work on integrating the insights daily
      and am very grateful for the experience and opportunity to connect with myself." _Ani_

  - heading: "Single origin"
    text: >
      Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known
      geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a
      specific collection of beans from a single country. The name of
      the coffee is then usually the place it was grown to whatever
      degree available.

  - heading: "Sustainable farming"
    text: >
      Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on
      an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of
      relationships between organisms and their environment. What
      grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and
      careful consideration for nature and communities.
