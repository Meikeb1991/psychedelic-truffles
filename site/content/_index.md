blurb:
    heading: "Why explore your mind?"
    text: "3 in 4 people consider a guided psychedelic journey in the top 5 of most meaningful experiences of their lives. It fits in the same bucket as the birth of their child or getting married. It has shown to catalyze deep psychological wellness and meaningful change." 
intro:
    heading: "How does it work?"
    text: "You will deep dive into the depths of your sub-consciousness which can lead to personal growth, emotional breakthroughs, and spiritual development. Neuroscientific research shows that the only way we can change the way we feel is by becoming aware of our inner experience and learning to befriend what is going inside ourselves. "
Am I ready:

      text: "You have a unique body and mind, with a particular history and conditioning. No one can offer you a formula for navigating all situations and      all states of mind. Only by listening inwardly in a fresh and open way will you discern at any given time what most serves your healing and freedom. In your dive, you will gather information about the currents that are impacting how you behave and feel today. Currents that are normally hidden from what the eye and mind can see. As long as you suppress information, you are fundamentally at war with yourself…The critical issue is allowing yourself to know what you know. That takes courage."

    heading: Our values
    text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
